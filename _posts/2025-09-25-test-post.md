# Sunglasses for a flat face

I am half asian. Love that for me; diversity hire incoming. Finding sunglasses is HELL. They either slide/fall, hit my actual eyeballs, fog up instantly, or give me a raging headache reminiscent of trying to find sunglasses. 

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
