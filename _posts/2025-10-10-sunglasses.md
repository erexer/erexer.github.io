I am half asian. Finding sunglasses is HELL. They either slide/fall, hit my eyeballs, fog up instantly, or give me a raging headache reminiscent of trying to find sunglasses. Here I will document which sunglasses I've tried, flame some of them, and applaud one of them. I judge sunglasses in three dimensions: **performance**, **dorkiness**, and **price**. Dorkiness can be both a positive and a negative, so I will specify below. This is entirely subjective; everyone's face is different.

|:----------------------------------------------|:------:|------:|-------------:| 
| [Sledge Lite](#tifosi-sledge-lite)            | Tifosi |   $80 |            7 |

#### [Tifosi Sledge Lite](https://tifosioptics.com/products/sledge-lite-sport-sunglasses?_pos=16&_fid=7d26c212d&_ss=c&variant=41027282600075) 
**7/10**

_\$80_

So far the best of the best. They stay on my face, aren't hideous (quite dorky, in what I like to think is a cute way), and are relatively affordable. I also had a fantastic customer service interaction with them in 2025 where they sent me a new pair because mine had a defect, which I'm convinced is actually a design flaw. I have two pairs. 


#### [Oakley Radar EV Path](https://www.oakley.com/en-us/product/W0OO9208?variant=888392280022)
**5/10**

_\$244_

Ugly as hell (dorky, derogative), very functional. I'd still have these except they snapped in half :(. 


#### [Smith Bobcat](https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/sunglass/bobcat-performance-sunglass/BOBCAT-SUNGLASSES.html) 
**3/10**

_\$247_

Way overpriced. Horse blinder vibes (no peripheral vision). They fit my face ok, but they tend to slide and fog up, and give me a headache from the pressure on the sides of my head. I think they're in style at least in outdoorsy communities. Sold my pair since I didn't like them. 


#### [Ombraz Viale](https://ombraz.com/products/viale-ombraz-armless-sunglasses?variant=42925733708027)
**2/10**

_\$190_

Price is the base \$160 plus the \$30 nose pad riser, their mod to make it a low bridge fit. 

I love the idea of no arms, but the fit on these are horrible. Without the extra nose pad riser, the glasses hit my eyeballs, with it they rest on my cheeks and against my forehead rather than on my nose. If they made a working version for low bridge fit I would LOVE these. Returned.
