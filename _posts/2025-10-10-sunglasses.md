I am half asian. Finding sunglasses is HELL. They either slide/fall, hit my eyeballs, fog up instantly, or give me a raging headache reminiscent of trying to find sunglasses. Here I will document which sunglasses I've tried, flame some of them, and applaud one of them. I judge sunglasses in three dimensions: **performance**, **dorkiness**, and **price**. Dorkiness can be both a positive and a negative, so I will specify below

1. [Tifosi Sledge Lite](#tifosi-sledge-lite)  $80 
2. [Smith Bobcat](https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/sunglass/bobcat-performance-sunglass/BOBCAT-SUNGLASSES.html) $247


##### 1. [Tifosi Sledge Lite](https://tifosioptics.com/products/sledge-lite-sport-sunglasses?_pos=16&_fid=7d26c212d&_ss=c&variant=41027282600075) $80
So far the best of the best. They stay on my face, aren't hideous, and are only $80.
